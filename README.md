 Introduction

KitchenHall is a modern and elegant e-commerce platform that offers a wide array of kitchen products—from high-tech appliances to everyday utensils. Inspired by the minimalist design of [JC Shop](http://www.jcshop.ph/00247304), this project was created using **React.js** to deliver a responsive, user-friendly experience to both professional chefs and home cooks alike.

I developed the front end of this project, while Harrison handled the back end, making sure the site operated smoothly and securely. This project serves as a key feature of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in front-end development, responsive design, and component-based architecture using React.js.

 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

 `npm run eject`

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  
For more information on how to configure and customize, check the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

 Project Workflow & Best Practices

 0. Comment All Your Code

Throughout the project, I made sure to comment on my code. All functions, components, and sections of the codebase contain comments that explain the logic and purpose behind them. This makes the project maintainable and readable for other developers or future updates.

 1. Clean Commit Messages

Each commit in the project is descriptive, ensuring that the history of the project reflects clear and logical progression. Commit messages follow a conventional format, summarizing the changes made concisely. If needed, I have cleaned up any unclear commit messages to maintain professionalism.

 2. File Organization

All unnecessary files such as temporary and cache files (`pycache`, etc.) have been removed. The file structure is organized and easy to navigate, focusing on simplicity and maintainability.

 3. Refactor & Simplify

Throughout the project, I refactored complex components and functions to ensure they followed the single-responsibility principle. This resulted in smaller, more modular, and reusable components.

### 4. Descriptive Variable Names

To ensure clarity, I avoided single-letter variable names (unless they served as temporary counters) and adopted meaningful, descriptive names that make the code easier to understand.

 Story Behind the Project

KitchenHall was inspired by my love for cooking and my desire to streamline the process of finding the perfect kitchen products. The challenge of building this app pushed me to explore new tools and frameworks, especially in the realm of front-end development using **React.js**. 

One of the key challenges I faced was handling state management in React while keeping the app responsive. I also focused on making the design mobile-friendly, ensuring that users have a smooth experience across devices. In the future, I aim to integrate a shopping cart feature and user authentication to elevate KitchenHall to a full-fledged e-commerce platform.

This project was a major step in honing my skills as a front-end developer, and I’m excited to keep improving it!
