 About the Project

The KitchenHall project is a sleek and user-friendly landing page that mirrors the engaging and professional design of [JC Shop](http://www.jcshop.ph/00247304). The project is built using React.js for the front end, with attention to responsiveness and modern UI/UX principles. The site is designed to guide users through our premium kitchen products and help them find exactly what they need to elevate their culinary skills.

I played the role of front-end developer for this project, utilizing React.js to ensure a smooth, seamless user experience. My partner, Harrison, handled the backend, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

 `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
